Minor mode for experiencing all the joys of a typewriter. \\
Forked from  [[https://github.com/ptrv/emacs.d/blob/master/site-lisp/misc/typewriter-mode.el][Peter Vasil's typewriter-mode]]. \\
Inspired by [[http://www.bobnewell.net/writer-typewriter.el][Bob Newell's writer-mode]].

* Why typewriters?
Typewriters are awesome. Take it from this guy:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
``Writing on a manual [typewriter] makes you slower in a good way, I think. You don't revise as much, you just think more, because you know you're going to have to retype the entire (flipping) thing. Which is a big stop on just slapping anything down and playing with it." -- Will Self
#+END_QUOTE

I made this because I have always wanted a typewriter, but I couldn't ever get a real one. This is also for those who wish to relive the days of the noisy typewriter, or to experience a taste of it for the first time, on a computer screen. I myself fall in the latter category (I do suppose, however, that most people using Emacs are old enough to have experienced typewriters. I might be one of the few late millennials using good ol' Emacs).

* Features
- Typewriter sounds
- Typewriter-style editing
  - Buffer scrolls to simulate carriage movement
  - Restricts editing to append-only and overstrike (slightly buggy, but can be disabled)
- Evil integration (uncomment code to enable)
